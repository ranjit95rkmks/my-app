1 .next/: This folder is auto-generated by Next.js when you build your project. It contains the compiled and optimized production build of your application. You generally don't need to interact with this folder directly.

2 components/: This folder contains React components that are reusable and used across multiple pages in your application. For example, you can have Header, Footer, and other UI components here.

3 pages/: This is a crucial folder in Next.js, where each file represents a route in your application. For example, index.js represents the home page accessible at the root URL ('/'). You can create as many pages as you need in this folder.

4 app.js: This special file is used to wrap every page with a custom App component. It is useful for adding layout, global styles, or context providers to your application.
5 document.js: This file allows you to customize the HTML document used in your application, like adding external scripts or meta tags.
public/: This folder contains static files (e.g., images, fonts) that are accessible by the browser. For example, if you have an image in public/images/, you can reference it in your code with /images/image-name.png.

5 styles/: This folder is for global styles and CSS modules. globals.css contains global CSS styles that apply to the entire application. You can also create CSS modules here for component-specific styles.

6 .eslintrc.js: This is the configuration file for ESLint, a tool used for code linting and formatting. It helps enforce coding standards and best practices in your project.

7 .gitignore: This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when committing changes. It typically includes build files, node_modules, and other files that don't need to be version-controlled.

8 package.json: This is the Node.js package file that lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

9 README.md: This is a markdown file that serves as the project's readme, providing information about the project, how to set it up, and other relevant details.
